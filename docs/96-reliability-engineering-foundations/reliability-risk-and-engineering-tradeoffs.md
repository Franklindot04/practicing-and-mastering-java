# Reliability Risk And Engineering Tradeoffs

Reliability work starts by naming the behavior precisely. A vague statement such as `the service is down` is less useful than a statement about the caller, dependency, symptom, time window, and recovery expectation.

## Risk Probability And Impact

Risk Probability And Impact describes a reliability concern that should be tied to observable evidence, caller impact, and a recovery decision. In Java systems, look for where the behavior appears in method boundaries, thread pools, network clients, persistence code, and exception handling.

Practical questions:

- What caller observes this behavior?
- Is the failure transient, persistent, partial, or caused by overload?
- Does retrying make the system safer, or does it amplify pressure?
- What signal would confirm recovery?

## Blast Radius

Blast Radius describes a reliability concern that should be tied to observable evidence, caller impact, and a recovery decision. In Java systems, look for where the behavior appears in method boundaries, thread pools, network clients, persistence code, and exception handling.

Practical questions:

- Is the failure transient, persistent, partial, or caused by overload?
- Does retrying make the system safer, or does it amplify pressure?
- What signal would confirm recovery?

## Recovery Cost

## Consistency Versus Availability

Consistency Versus Availability describes a reliability concern that should be tied to observable evidence, caller impact, and a recovery decision. In Java systems, look for where the behavior appears in method boundaries, thread pools, network clients, persistence code, and exception handling.

Practical questions:

## Latency Versus Reliability

Latency Versus Reliability describes a reliability concern that should be tied to observable evidence, caller impact, and a recovery decision. In Java systems, look for where the behavior appears in method boundaries, thread pools, network clients, persistence code, and exception handling.

Practical questions:

- What caller observes this behavior?

## Retries Versus Overload Risk

Retries Versus Overload Risk describes a reliability concern that should be tied to observable evidence, caller impact, and a recovery decision. In Java systems, look for where the behavior appears in method boundaries, thread pools, network clients, persistence code, and exception handling.

Practical questions:

- What caller observes this behavior?

- Does retrying make the system safer, or does it amplify pressure?
- What signal would confirm recovery?

## Prevention Detection Mitigation And Recovery

Prevention Detection Mitigation And Recovery describes a reliability concern that should be tied to observable evidence, caller impact, and a recovery decision. In Java systems, look for where the behavior appears in method boundaries, thread pools, network clients, persistence code, and exception handling.

Practical questions:

- What caller observes this behavior?

## Risk Registers And Failure-Mode Reviews

Risk Registers And Failure-Mode Reviews describes a reliability concern that should be tied to observable evidence, caller impact, and a recovery decision. In Java systems, look for where the behavior appears in method boundaries, thread pools, network clients, persistence code, and exception handling.

Practical questions:

- What caller observes this behavior?
- Is the failure transient, persistent, partial, or caused by overload?
- Does retrying make the system safer, or does it amplify pressure?
- What signal would confirm recovery?

## Reliability By System Criticality

Reliability By System Criticality describes a reliability concern that should be tied to observable evidence, caller impact, and a recovery decision. In Java systems, look for where the behavior appears in method boundaries, thread pools, network clients, persistence code, and exception handling.

Practical questions:

- What caller observes this behavior?
- Is the failure transient, persistent, partial, or caused by overload?
- Does retrying make the system safer, or does it amplify pressure?
- What signal would confirm recovery?

## Java-Oriented Example

```java
try {
    return dependency.call(request);
} catch (TransientDependencyException ex) {
    // Retry only when the operation is safe and the request still has budget.
    throw ex;
}
```

The example is intentionally small: the important lesson is not a library choice, but the decision to classify failure before choosing retry, fallback, rejection, or recovery.

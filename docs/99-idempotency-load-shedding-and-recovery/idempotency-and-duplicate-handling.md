# Idempotency And Duplicate Handling

Reliability work starts by naming the behavior precisely. A vague statement such as `the service is down` is less useful than a statement about the caller, dependency, symptom, time window, and recovery expectation.

## Mathematical And Operational Idempotency

Mathematical And Operational Idempotency describes a reliability concern that should be tied to observable evidence, caller impact, and a recovery decision. In Java systems, look for where the behavior appears in method boundaries, thread pools, network clients, persistence code, and exception handling.

Practical questions:

- What caller observes this behavior?
- Is the failure transient, persistent, partial, or caused by overload?
- Does retrying make the system safer, or does it amplify pressure?
- What signal would confirm recovery?

## Java-Oriented Example

```java
try {
    return dependency.call(request);
} catch (TransientDependencyException ex) {
    // Retry only when the operation is safe and the request still has budget.
    throw ex;
}
```

The example is intentionally small: the important lesson is not a library choice, but the decision to classify failure before choosing retry, fallback, rejection, or recovery.
